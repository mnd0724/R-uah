            "abstract": "Numerous papers have shown the negative consequences of large-scale low-income households segregation. However, both (i) the development of gated communities that have transformed Latin-American peripheries, as well as (ii) the emergence of new forms of urbanization in urban expansion areas, generate a diversification of segregation experiences among low-income households. This article presents a comparison of the experience of segregation among those households living in social housing in the compact periphery, and those living in urban expansion areas. Based on a mixed-methods research focused on three Chilean cities, findings confirm differences in (i) access to local services and infrastructure, (ii) perception of security, and (iii) territorial identities. In consequence, segregation is lived differently both in objective or material terms, and in symbolic and territorial stigma terms. We conclude discussing the applicability of the term “segregations” (in plural) and multiple territorial identities to address this phenomenon.",

Much less attention is being paid to that type of nature close to where people live and work, to small-scale green areas in cities and to their benefits to people. Increasing empirical evidence, however, indicates that the presence of natural areas contributes to the quality of life in many ways. Besides many environmental and ecological services, urban nature provides important social and psychological benefits to human societies, which enrich human life with meanings and emotions. The main concern of this paper is to address the importance of urban nature for citizens’ well being and for the sustainability of the city they inhabit. Some results of a survey conducted among visitors of an urban park in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) are presented and discussed. The issues investigated concern people’s motives for urban nature, the emotional dimension involved in the experience of nature and its importance for people’s general well being. Results confirm that the experience of nature in urban environment is source of positive feelings and beneficial services, which fulfill important immaterial and non-consumptive human needs. Implications for the sustainability of the city will be analyzed and discussed.",

However, in cities polarized along socio-economic lines, the benefits of densification are not so evident. The aim of this paper is to discuss some of the contradictions of densification in Santiago de Chile, a city characterized by socio-spatial disparities. To that end, we first use regression analysis to explain differences in density rates within the city. The regression analysis shows that dwelling density depends on the distance from the city center, socioeconomic conditions, and the availability of urban attributes in the area. After understanding the density profile, we discuss the implications for travel and the distribution of social infrastructures and the environmental services provided by green areas. While, at the metropolitan scale, densification may favor a more sustainable travel pattern, it should be achieved by balancing density rates and addressing spatial differences in the provision of social services and environmental amenities. We believe a metropolitan approach is essential to correct these spatial imbalances and to promote a more sustainable and socially cohesive growth pattern.",

This study examines how individuals form these perceptions and explores their potential impact on preferences for redistribution. A tailored household survey provides original evidence on systematic biases in individuals’ evaluations of their own relative position in the income distribution. The study discusses one of the mechanisms that may generate such biases, based on the extrapolation of information from endogenous reference groups, and presents some suggestive evidence that this mechanism has significant explanatory power. The impact of these biased perceptions on attitudes toward redistributive policies is studied by means of an experimental design that was incorporated into the survey, which provided consistent information on the own-ranking within the income distribution to a randomly selected group of respondents. The evidence suggests that those who had overestimated their relative position and thought that they were relatively richer than they were tend to demand higher levels of redistribution when informed of their true ranking.",

            "abstract": "Green spaces are one important indicator of urban quality of life. Yet urban green space research is often carried out in industrialized nations, with relatively little known about green space use and preferences in rapidly urbanizing cities in developing countries. With high levels of urbanization and widening inequalities in many Latin American cities, it is necessary to evaluate green space situated within cultural and geographical contexts. In this study, green space usability was explored by examining preferences, perceptions, and access barriers of parks and urban green space using on-site individual semi-structured interviews and systematic observations of behavior among a purposive sample of urban residents. We sought to determine whether certain sectors of the urban population have access to green space in close proximity of their homes and localized patterns of use in (municipal) urban parks and neighborhood parks. The revitalization and construction of urban parks in the last decade in Santa Cruz, Bolivia was found to reduce access barriers for residents by providing more desirable and safer public spaces for leisure and recreation. However, gender disparities were found in terms of usage and we document unequal distribution of larger and more desirable green spaces throughout sectors of the city, so that not all urban residents are experiencing such benefits. Results highlight the potential importance of designing green spaces to serve as equalizers in urban areas characterized by social and spatial inequalities.",

            "abstract": "Numerosos trabajos evidencian las consecuencias negativas de la segregación a gran escala para los hogares de bajos ingresos. Sin embargo, tanto las transformaciones territoriales en la periferia de las ciudades latinoamericanas, asociadas al desarrollo de barrios cerrados de ingresos medios y altos, como el surgimiento de nuevas formas de urbanización en zonas de expansión urbana, generan una diversificación de las formas de segregación que experimentan los hogares de sectores populares. Este artículo presenta una investigación con métodos mixtos para tres ciudades chilenas y sus extra-radios, cuyo objetivo fue comparar la experiencia de segregación de hogares que residen en vivienda social en la periferia popular y compacta, con la de hogares que habitan en vivienda social en zonas de expansión urbana. Los hallazgos confirman diferencias de acceso a equipamiento y servicios en lo local, percepción de seguridad e identidades territoriales. Puesto que la segregación se vive de forma diferente en estas distintas situaciones urbanas, tanto en términos objetivos o materiales, como en términos simbólicos y de estigma territorial, es más apropiado hablar de segregaciones e identidades territoriales múltiples.",
